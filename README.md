# 📊 Mastering Matplotlib with Real Data Insights

Welcome to the **Matplotlib Practice & Project Notebook**, where we explore the full potential of Python's most popular visualization library. This repo contains well-structured, beginner-to-intermediate level plots enhanced with real-world data and styling techniques.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

### 🎨 Core Plot Types:
- Line Plot: Trends and signals
- Bar Chart: Categorical comparisons
- Scatter Plot: Relationship between variables
- Pie Chart: Proportions
- Area Chart & Subplots
- Histograms & Boxplots: Distribution & spread

### ⚙️ Customizations:
- Colors, markers, fonts, and line styles
- Legends, annotations, math text (`$\frac{1}{\sin x}$`)
- Custom stylesheets and themes (`ggplot`, `fivethirtyeight`)

### 📁 Real-World Dataset:
Used a cleaned CSV: `indian_grandmasters_july_2020.csv`  
- State-wise GM count (pie & bar)
- Year of birth analysis (time series)
- Rating distribution (histogram)
- Ratings boxplot
- Decade-wise GM pie analysis
